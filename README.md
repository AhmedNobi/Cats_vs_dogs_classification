# Cats_vs_dogs_classification
This repository is about computer vision project.
We have two classes dogs and cats. We know that mobilenet and vgg16 both are functional model while we use Sequential model to create neural networks. Before we were iterating over all layers from vgg16 to a sequential model. We are directly using the model itself.
